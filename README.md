# analyticalLaval

The code solves for the mach number and the pressure distribution inside a given laval nozzle / convergent divergent nozzle.
It takes the pressures at input and output, as well as a nozzle function as input, calculated mach number and pressure distributions and the shock location (if there is a shock)

## Background
This code comes from an older university project where it was used to validate CFD-results.
